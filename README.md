## Features

### Obsidian Compatibility
- **JSON Canvas format** — data saved in Obsidian-compatible format (hex colors, standard fields)
- **Export .canvas file** — one-click export to `data/assets/CanvasFiles/`; automatically registered as a referenced asset
- **Cross-app viewing** — exported `.canvas` files open correctly in Obsidian with proper card borders and edge colors

### Preview & Edit Modes
- **Preview mode** (default) — clean viewing: toolbars hidden, no accidental edits; pan/zoom/select only
- **Edit mode** — full editing: cards, connections, resize, drag, toolbar visible
- **Floating toggle** — 👁 button always visible at top-right; **⊞** fit-all and **↺** reset-zoom buttons also always accessible

### Cards
- **Text cards** — Markdown content, 8 colors, rounded/rect shapes, solid/dashed borders
- **Group cards** — dashed-border containers with renamable header, always behind other cards
- **Drag from toolbar** — drag card/group buttons onto canvas, preview follows cursor
- **Auto-edit** — new text cards enter edit mode immediately; `<textarea>` for reliable line breaks and Tab indentation

### Connections
- **Bezier curves** — drag from card edge anchors to create smooth connections between cards
- **Anchor snapping** — drag a connection near a target card's anchor to snap into place
- **Arrows** — directional arrow markers on connection lines
- **Reconnect** — drag edge endpoints to reconnect to different cards in real-time
- **Obsidian-style edge color** — subtle gray (`#7c7c7c`) matching Obsidian's default

### Canvas & Navigation
- **Infinite canvas** — pan (middle-mouse / Space+drag / touch), zoom (scroll wheel / pinch)
- **Floating zoom controls** — **⊞** fit-all and **↺** reset-zoom always visible; `+` / `−` / percentage in toolbar
- **Adaptive grid** — radial-dot grid scales with zoom level
- **Touch support** — single-finger pan, two-finger pinch zoom

### Selection & Editing
- **Click** to select, **drag** to move, **resize handles** on all four corners and edges
- **Alignment guides** — snap to other cards' edges and centers, with magenta guide lines during drag
- **Option/Alt-drag** — duplicate a card by holding Option (Mac) / Alt (Win/Linux) while dragging
- **Option/Alt+Shift-drag** — duplicate and lock to horizontal/vertical axis
- **Marquee selection** — drag on empty canvas to select multiple cards, then drag the selection box to move them all at once
- **Keyboard nudge** — arrow keys (±5px), `Shift+arrow` (±20px)
- **Copy/Paste** (`Ctrl/Cmd+C/V`), **Duplicate** (`Ctrl/Cmd+D`), **Delete** (`Backspace`)
- **Undo/Redo** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Z` / `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z`) — 50-step history, strict step-by-step

### Settings (persist across sessions)
- **Snap to grid** — on by default, aligns nodes to 20px grid during drag
- **Align objects** — snap to other cards' edges
- **Read-only mode** — disables all editing, hides toolbar completely
- **Export as PNG** (`Ctrl/Cmd+E`) — saves to `data/assets/`

### Storage — No Orphaned Files
- **Primary**: block attribute `custom-canvas-data` — data lives and dies with the widget block
- **Backup**: `data/widgets/siyuan-canvas-widget/data/<blockID>.canvas` — organized in `data/` subdirectory
- **Auto-save** — debounced 300ms, both block attribute and file on every change
- **Automatic migration** — old data from `/data/assets/CanvasFiles/` or flat widget directory migrates on load
